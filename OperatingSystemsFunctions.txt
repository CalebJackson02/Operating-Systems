Automatic Updates is one example of an operating system function. 
Automatic updates allow your computer to add, or remove, features 
from your operating system. These updates are to help correct any 
problems, and bring new features to make the users experience better.

User Interface is another example of an operating system function. 
UI is what allows data to be entered into a system and is how 
information is entered onto the screen. It is the way we interact
with the computer.
